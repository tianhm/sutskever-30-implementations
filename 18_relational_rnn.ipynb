    "### Paper Summary\n",
    "The Relational RNN paper introduces a novel architecture that augments recurrent neural networks with a relational memory core. The key innovation is the incorporation of multi-head attention mechanisms into RNNs, enabling the model to learn and reason about relationships between memory elements over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Contributions\n",
    "1. **Relational Memory Core**: A memory mechanism that uses multi-head attention to model interactions between memory slots\n",
    "2. **Multi-Head Attention**: Enables the network to focus on different relationships simultaneously\n",
    "3. **Sequential Reasoning**: Demonstrates improved performance on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Highlights\n",
    "- Combines RNN cells with attention-based memory updates\n",
    "- Maintains multiple memory slots that interact through attention\n",
    "- Supports long-range dependencies through relational reasoning"
